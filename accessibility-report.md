# Accessibility Report

1. Equitable Use
   Current Features: The application uses clear and simple language accessible to users with varying levels of 
   experience in cryptocurrency management. It offers both visual and text-based feedback (like error messages and 
   status updates) to accommodate different user preferences.
   
   Future Implementations: Adding audio descriptions and voice commands could make the app more equitable, 
   allowing users with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory learning to access all functionalities.

2. Flexibility in Use
   Current Features: The application maintains a standard layout and interface designed to accommodate a wide range of 
   users by default.
   
   Future Implementations: To enhance flexibility, the application could incorporate features that allow users to adjust 
   text sizes, choose high-contrast themes, or rearrange components of the dashboard to suit their personal preferences 
   or accessibility needs. This could include features like a dark mode or the ability to select different color schemes
   to assist users with visual impairments.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use
   Current Features: The interface is intuitive, with consistently placed navigation buttons and a predictable user 
   flow from login to transaction management, which benefits all users, especially those unfamiliar with complex 
   software.
   
   Future Implementations: Providing step-by-step tutorials or help sections within the app can help new users 
   understand how to manage their portfolios effectively.

4. Perceptible Information
   Current Features: The application provides clear visual cues and feedback for operations, such as changing the color 
   of buttons when they are active or displaying transaction confirmation messages.
   
   Future Implementations: Adding auditory feedback or spoken confirmations can make information more perceptible for 
   users who have low vision or learning difficulties.

5. Tolerance for Error
   Current Features: The application confirms actions such as buying or selling cryptocurrencies to prevent accidental 
   transactions, which is critical for preventing potentially costly mistakes.
   
   Future Implementations: Implementing more robust undo features or allowing users a brief period to cancel 
   transactions after execution can further increase error tolerance.

6. Low Physical Effort
   Current Features: The application can be navigated entirely via mouse or keyboard inputs, allowing users with 
   limited motor skills to use the software without requiring fine motor precision.
   
   Future Implementations: Voice-activated controls could be added to reduce the need for physical navigation and 
   input even further.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
   Current Features: The application's UI elements are large enough to interact with comfortably on various devices 
   including tablets and mobile phones.
   
   Future Implementations: Adjusting the layout automatically based on the device's orientation and screen size can 
   ensure better accessibility across all devices.
   
   Marketing Strategy
   The application would be marketed towards individual investors interested in cryptocurrency but intimidated by the 
   complexity often associated with these investments. It offers an accessible, user-friendly platform that simplifies 
   portfolio management, tracking, and news aggregation. Ideal users include both novice and seasoned investors who 
   appreciate a streamlined approach to managing digital assets, with additional supportive features that cater to 
   those with accessibility needs. This focus on usability and accessibility can make the app particularly appealing to
   an older demographic or those new to technology and investing.
